    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. I woke up this morning to my lady gaga alarm clock, only to realize that I was already late for my favourite class: English. I’m so sorry. And although I am slightly empty handed, its for significant reason. This is lil cheeko. He’s a chewer. Chews my shoes, chews my furniture, evens chews his own legs. Most unfortunate for me though, his greatest desire seems to be to chew my work. But even on top of lil cheeko, there was his friend Mrs. Sharp. This morning I am brushing my teeth, and as I turn to face the window, out of the corner of my eye, I witness an absolute horror. Lil cheeko’s friend of 4 years, Barnard, appearing as only a ball of fur on the road outside, was just moments away from being run over. *Car crash noise* *squeek type noise* (From barnard, maybe not too real though). I’m no litigious man, but even I would have pressed charges against myself if I hadn’t come to Barnard’s rescue. The inhumanity of it. I had to go. After incompetent inspection, it was clear Barnard’s life was at stake and that something had to be done. He wasn’t moving in the slightest. After buckling him into the passenger seat, his body all mangled, we zipped to the closest veterinary clinic. I was breathing heavily, scraping at the door to get in as quickly as possible. I placed Barnard as gently as I could on the counter as to not injure him any further, and as I placed him down, the doctor began to laugh. To my humiliation, Barnard was in fact a child's toy. But regardless of that fact, I did the right thing. I could have potentially saved a poor puppy’s life. All of this extravagance on top of my last two cousins marrying each other just this morning, its no wonder I’m late and empty-handed. I know I have said it before, but this really is the last time Mrs. Sharp. It won’t happen again. </p>
