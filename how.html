    <h2>Failing Your Driving Test</h2>

          <div class="centerText">Walking to your scheduled driving test would be a sure way to fail the test but it would also be far too easy. This “How To” guide’s purpose is to convince the driving evaluator that you are trying your absolute hardest, but whole-heartedly and rather tragically haven’t quite got a grip on driving. You must fail, but only just, and they must be left perplexed, wondering exactly what has just happened. The key to this confusion is everything leading up to you putting your hands on the steering wheel, and everything just before parking up at the end. Any impressive skill showing your coordination and competence, something such as juggling, should be demonstrated shortly after entering the evaluator’s building. On the way out, you must approach the car with a charismatic, determined trot. At this point, the evaluator should question whether it is you, or themselves who is about to be evaluated. Respond quickly, correctly and confidently to the theory questions — left arm out means turning left, left arm down means slowing down, etc. Once you’ve taken your rightful place behind the steering wheel, honk the horn for yourself before the evaluator asks, and if you are feeling extra cheeky, ask them to apply the brakes while you check if their lights are working. Once satisfied, the challenge of driving begins. Most cars, even those with automatic transmission have a low gear. If you are blessed with one of these, assertively shift the lever to this position. From hereon, this driving portion can be made to be the easiest part of the test. For lanes changes and turns, shoulder checks are imperative, and one over each shoulder before executing a turn not only does no harm, but shows your keenness as a driver. This same principle applies to signalling. Later in the examination, you will be required to do either a two-point, or a three-point turn. In either of these cases, maneuver as slowly as possible. Being conscious that your evaluation lasts only 15 minutes is actually an advantage. In the final stretch, you are likely to be asked to parallel park the vehicle. As this is foreseeably the final task, this must be done perfectly. On the drive back to where it all began, keep shoulder checks to the one shoulder, and signals to only the direction you are turning, In other words drive without flaw. Once the car is parked in its lot and you are parked in your seat awaiting your result, remain calm. When the verdict does arrive, thank your evaluator, perhaps even apologize, and just remember that you can’t really fail if that was your goal.</div>
